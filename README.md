# QTasker ðŸ’¡
**Quick-Tasker** (Easy, one step at a time.)

_The slogan or motto "Easy, on the go" denotes to tasks being able to be written down and fulfilled quickly anywhere at anytime._

--------------------------

### **Objective:**

The main objectives of this project is to make students have an easier time reading text-based messages for simplicity and not having to be stressed or overwhelmed with many future tasks. Task organization is critical to individual and team success. I will make sure to create a task management program that allows the user to organize their tasks efficiently and easily by implementing searching and sorting algorithms. I will also ensure that the application is very easy to use in which a task can be simply added and deleted with a call.

    Some of the applications that the project will provide include: 
    - Variety of functions such as allowing the user to add, delete, or edit tasks
    - Where the user will be able to search for these tasks by entering specific words that are indicated in the task, by due dates, and urgency
    - Users having an option to list categories

    Some of the things that the project will not cover is things like (Potential Future Implementations): 
    - AI integration - Images/visualizations
    - a GUI system
    - Other advanced calendar systems such as reminders

# Planning Write Up

Depicted below is the Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagram for the application QTasker, a simple to-do task manager. I know that many students struggle with focusing on their tasks when they have various assignments delagated to them. I also know that students may be procrastinators
and get burnt out eventually, leading them to get overwhelmed and slack off when visualizing many deadlines, which ultimately results in failure and bad preparation. I find that things can get very crammed on the calendar sometimes which makes it uneasy for individuals to read. Therefore, I planned to create this project by aiming to solve making tasks more readable and simpler by allowing individuals to find any tasks they need to do on specific days to ensure that they have completed all their "to-dos" for the day.
