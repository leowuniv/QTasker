# QTasker
**Quick-Tasker** (Easy, one step at a time.)

_The slogan or motto "Easy, on the go" denotes to tasks being able to be written down and fulfilled quickly anywhere at anytime._

--------------------------

### **Objective:**

The main objectives of this project is to make students have an easier time reading text-based messages for simplicity and not having to be stressed or overwhelmed with many future tasks. Task organization is critical to individual and team success. I will make sure to create a task management program that allows the user to organize their tasks efficiently and easily by implementing searching and sorting algorithms. I will also ensure that the application is very easy to use in which a task can be simply added and deleted with a call.

    Some of the applications that the project will provide include: 
    - Variety of functions such as allowing the user to add, delete, or edit tasks
    - Where the user will be able to search for these tasks by entering specific words that are indicated in the task, by due dates, and urgency
    - Users having an option to list categories

    Some of the things that the project will not cover is things like (Potential Future Implementations): 
    - AI integration - Images/visualizations
    - a GUI system
    - Other advanced calendar systems such as reminders
